User Story
----------
As a sales director of video games, I want to know the history of video games sales by genres and regions so that I can make a decision on what types of video games we need to produce and direct the distribution of our products. Furthermore, I want to use the history to identify trends that would help me make market decisions for a future, like not investing in platforms that are not showing a growing trend in certain regions. Given that the sales manager want to find related sales information , when he/she selects feature(s), then our platform produces a visual analysis as well as future predictive modelling for features.
